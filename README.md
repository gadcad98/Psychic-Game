# Psychic-Game

This is a basic guessing game using HTML, "vanilla" Javascript and some minimal CSS.

The idea of the game is for the code to choose a random letter from the "alphabet" array.

The user then has ten attempts to guess which letter in the array has been chosen at random.
  
If the user guesses correctly before the "Guesses Left" counter gets to 0 (zero) their "Wins" increase by 1.
  
If the user doesn't guess the random letter before the "Guesses Left" counter gets to zero their "Losses" increase by 1.
  
When the "Guesses Left" counter gets to zero, or the random letter is guessed, the code chooses a new random letter and the game starts  over again.
