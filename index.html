    <!-- Psychic Game -->

<!-- 1. The program generates a letter at random -->
<!-- 2. The player picks a random letter A-Z on the keyboard -->
<!-- 3. The player gets 9 attempts to guess correctly -->
<!-- 4. If the player guesses the letter correctly within the 9 attempt limit his score is tallied in the "Wins" row -->
<!-- 5. If the player guesses incorrectly the amount on "Guesses Left" row is reduced by one and his letter is stored on the "Your Guesses so Far" row -->
<!-- 6. If the player DOES NOT guess the randomly generated letter by the end of his 9 attempts his score is then tallied in the "Losses" row  -->
